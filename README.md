Program provided by ChatGPT3.5 from OpenAI.

This program's function is to change the position of the mouse cursor to another monitor. Through a customized shortcut, you can toggle the cursor position between different monitors. This program was designed to be used with GRID-NAV from KEYNAV, as the navigation grid depends on which monitor the cursor is on. ChatGPT has limitations, but with the command `xrandr --listactivemonitors` to list the monitors, ChatGPT was able to easily create this program. 

For use just run:

```
chmod +x move_cursor_to_monitor.sh
./move_cursor_to_monitor.sh
```
